Tetris react app inspired by [One Lonely Coder](https://youtu.be/8OK8_tHeCIA)

The idea was to create a fully featured tetris using react. 
I could handle myself and added a couple of dependencies to support graphql request to store data, cookie management and material ui for nice buttons.

Features:
- keyboard support as well as on screen buttons
- responsive, mobile and desktop ready
- save your score and compete with others

PRs are welcomed.
